## Description

This is the long description. No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).

A few notes about the sections above:

-   "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.orgusernames
-   "Stable tag" is not needed for themes
-   "Tags" is not needed since these are parsed from the style.css file
-   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
-   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've _successfully used to test the theme_. Note that it might work on
    higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
